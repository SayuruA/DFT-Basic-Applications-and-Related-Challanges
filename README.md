# Project Title: **Discrete Fourier Transform, Basic Applications, and Related Challanges**

## Description

This project is based on an assignment related to **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** and **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** but extends beyond to generalize concepts of:

- **Identifying harmonics** in a noisy signal
- **Retrieving the original signal** from a downsampled version
